## ✅ What's Working Now

Your **MedInSight chat interface** is live at:

```
http://localhost:8000/query
```

## 🌐 Access Your App

| URL | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| http://localhost:8000/query | **Chat Interface** (Open this!) |
| http://localhost:8000/api/query | API endpoint |
| http://localhost:8000/health | Health check |

---

## ⚠️ Current Status: DEMO MODE

**Why Demo Mode?**
Your OpenAI API key has no remaining credits.

**What Works:**
- ✅ Chat UI loads and looks professional
- ✅ You can type and send questions
- ✅ System returns answers with citations
- ✅ All UI features work perfectly

**What's Limited:**
- ⚠️ Uses mock embeddings (hash-based, not real AI)
- ⚠️ Retrieval is keyword-based, not semantic
- ⚠️ No actual GPT-4o generation

## 🚀 For Hack-A-Cure Submission

### You MUST Fix the API Key

**Option 1: Add Credits (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add payment method
3. Add $5-10 in credits
4. Wait 5-10 minutes
5. Run these commands:

```bash
# Kill demo server
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Run real ingestion
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-with-credits"
python ingest_simple.py

# Start production server
python app.py
```

**Option 2: New Free Trial**
1. Create new OpenAI account (different email)
2. Get $5 free credits with new API key
3. Same steps as Option 1
