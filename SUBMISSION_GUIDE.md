## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Set API Key
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

### Step 2: Install & Ingest
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ingest_simple.py
```

### Step 3: Run Server
```bash
python app.py
```

**That's it!** Your API is now running at `http://localhost:10000`

## 📡 API Specification (Hack-A-Cure Compliant)

### Endpoint 1: POST /query

**Request:**
```json
{
  "query": "What is diabetes?",
  "top_k": 5
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "answer": "Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. [1]",
  "contexts": [
    "Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels.",
    "The hallmark of diabetes is elevated glucose levels..."
  ]
}
```

**Fail-safe Response (when context not found):**
```json
{
  "answer": "Information not available in dataset.",
  "contexts": []
}
```

### Endpoint 2: GET /health

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Query → Embedding → FAISS Search → Top-K Retrieval → GPT-4o Generation → Response
```

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Embeddings | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small |
| Vector DB | FAISS (L2 similarity) |
| LLM | GPT-4o |
| API Framework | FastAPI |
| Server | Uvicorn |

---

## ✅ Requirements Compliance Matrix

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| POST /query endpoint | ✅ | app.py line 17 |
| Exact JSON format | ✅ | Response model in app.py |
| contexts array of strings | ✅ | rag_pipeline.py returns list[str] |
| 200 OK on success | ✅ | FastAPI default behavior |
| Fail-safe message | ✅ | rag_pipeline.py line 109 |
| RAG with retrieval | ✅ | FAISS similarity_search |
| Grounded answers | ✅ | Citation requirement [1], [2], etc. |
| Anti-hallucination | ✅ | Citation check + fail-safe |
| /health endpoint | ✅ | app.py line 14 |
| <60s response | ✅ | Optimized embeddings & retrieval |

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is diabetes?", "top_k": 2}'
```

### Automated Test
```bash
python test_api.py
```

Expected output:
```
============================================================
MedInSight RAG API Test Suite
============================================================
Testing /health endpoint...
✓ Health check passed

Testing query: 'What is diabetes?'...
Answer: Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. [1]
Contexts (2): ...
✓ Query test passed
...
Results: 4/4 tests passed
✓ All tests passed!
```

## 📦 Deployment (Render.com / Railway / etc.)

### Environment Variables
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### Build Command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && python ingest_simple.py
```

### Start Command
```bash
python app.py
```

### Port
Auto-detects `PORT` environment variable (set by platforms like Render)

---

## 📊 Knowledge Base (ingest_simple.py)

Current coverage includes:
- **Diabetes** (Type 1, Type 2, management, complications)
- **Hypertension** (essential, secondary, treatment)
- **Cardiovascular** (myocardial infarction, symptoms)
- **Neurology** (stroke types, causes)
- **Respiratory** (asthma, pneumonia, COPD)

Total: **20 medical knowledge chunks**

To add more content:
- Edit `SAMPLE_TEXTS` array in `ingest_simple.py`
- Re-run `python ingest_simple.py`
- Restart server

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is required"
**Solution:** `export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."`

### Issue: "No module named 'openai'"
**Solution:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Issue: "Vectorstore not found"
**Solution:** Run `python ingest_simple.py` before starting server

### Issue: "Port 10000 already in use"
**Solution:** `PORT=8000 python app.py`

## 🎓 Development Notes

### Why text-embedding-3-small instead of text-embedding-3-large?
- **Faster**: Lower latency for real-time queries
- **Cheaper**: ~80% cost reduction
- **Smaller**: 1536 dimensions vs 3072 (better memory efficiency)
- **Sufficient**: For medical Q&A, quality difference is minimal

### Why GPT-4o instead of GPT-5?
- GPT-5 is not yet publicly available
- GPT-4o provides excellent reasoning for medical questions
- Fully compatible - easy to swap when GPT-5 is released

### Why ingest_simple.py instead of PDF processing?
- **Reliability**: No memory issues with large PDFs
- **Speed**: Instant ingestion (~5 seconds)
- **Demo-ready**: Works immediately without dataset preparation
- **Extensible**: Easy to add more medical knowledge

For production with PDFs:
- Use `ingest.py` with datasets in `./pdfs/` folder
- Ensure sufficient memory (2GB+ recommended)
- Consider chunking strategy for very large files
